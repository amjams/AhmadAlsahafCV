### Experience

**Post-doctoral researcher - University Medical Center Groningen (2021 - 2024)**  
I work at the [Giepmans group](https://bscs.umcg.nl/en/groups/giepmans-group/) where my primary focus is the analysis of cellular images from large-scale electron microscopy.
- Hyperspectral analysis of X-ray dispersive data ([recently published in npj Imaging](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44303-024-00059-7)).
- Segmentation of large-scale electron microscopy data in life sciences ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37572414/)).
- Supervision of MSc and PhD students.
- FAIR data management of EM data and experience in open-source microscopy formats.
- Lead the publishing of [following dataset](https://doi.org/10.17867/10000168), which won the [RUG Open Research award](https://www.rug.nl/research/openscience/open-research-award/case-studies-list-2022/winners/winner-2022-fair-data-management-of-a-large-scale-electron-microscopy-database-for-type-1-diab?lang=en).

**PhD student in computer science - University of Groningen (Feb 2016 - Dec 2020)**  
I did my doctoral studies at the [Intelligent systems group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/is/) under supervision of Prof. Nicolai Petkov and Dr. George Azzopardi, as part of an STW-funded project in collaboration with Wageningen University & Research.        
My thesis covered the following topics:
  1) Feature selection through the mechanism of boosting ([paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421012513), [repo](https://github.com/amjams/FeatBoost)).
  2) Interpretable machine learning applied to livestock data.

**Research fellow - Politecnico di Milano (2015)**  
I was a post-graduate research fellow and member of the EU project SmartH2O for urban water management.
