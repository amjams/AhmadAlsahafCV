## Experience

**Post-doctoral researcher** @ University Medical Center Groningen _(March 2021 - Present)_ <br>
I worked at the [Giepmans group](https://bscs.umcg.nl/en/groups/giepmans-group/) where my primary focus was the analysis of cellular images from large-scale electron microscopy.
  - Hyperspectral analysis of X-ray dispersive data (ongoing project).
  - Segmentation of large-scale electron microscopy data in life sciences ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37572414/))
  - Supervision of MSc and PhD students.
  - _FAIR_ data management of EM data and experience in open-source microscopy formats.
  - Lead the publishing of following (dataset)[https://doi.org/10.17867/10000168], which won the RUG Open Research (award)[https://www.rug.nl/research/openscience/open-research-award/case-studies-list-2022/winners/winner-2022-fair-data-management-of-a-large-scale-electron-microscopy-database-for-type-1-diab?lang=en].

**PhD student in computer science** @University of Groningen  _(Feb 2016 - Dec 2020)_ <br>
I did my PhD at [Intelligent systems group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/is/) under supervision of Prof. Nicolai Petkov and Dr. George Azzopardi.
My thesis covered the two following topics:
  1) Feature selection through the mechanism of boosting ([paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421012513), [repo](https://github.com/amjams/FeatBoost)).
  2) Interpretable machine learning applied to livestock data ([Excerpt from thesis](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/145238081/Title_and_contents.pdf)).
